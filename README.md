##  Core Features

* **Contextual AI Mentor:** Provides Socratic-style hints for LeetCode problems using the Google Gemini API without revealing the direct solution.
* **Persistent Chat History:** Remembers your conversation for each specific problem, even after refreshing or navigating away.
* **Personalized Review List:** Automatically captures AI-recommended problems when you're stuck, consolidates them by topic into a collapsible UI, and allows you to "Mark as Done."
* **Data-Driven Analytics Dashboard:**
    * **Mastery Score:** Visualizes your overall proficiency with a dynamic donut chart.
    * **Skills Breakdown:** Displays your strengths and weaknesses with gradient-colored skill tags.
* **Secure & Serverless:** Built on a "Bring Your Own Key" (BYOK) model, ensuring user privacy and infinite scalability with zero backend costs.
* **Polished UI:** Features a custom floating button, a draggable tabbed interface, and a seamless onboarding experience for new users.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

* **Frontend:** JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3
* **Extension Framework:** Chrome Extension APIs (Manifest V3)
* **Core APIs:** `chrome.storage`, `chrome.scripting`, `chrome.runtime`
* **AI:** Google Gemini API
* **Data Visualization:** Chart.js
* **Architecture:** The extension is fully **serverless**. It operates on a **"Bring Your Own Key" (BYOK)** model where all logic runs on the client-side. The content script interacts with the LeetCode DOM, the background script handles privileged operations, and all data is securely stored in the user's local browser storage.
